This was a project made in 5 days in a hackathon organised by IOSD called innovision.

The theme of the hackathon was related to the current ongoing covid-19 pandemic. We had to work any of three field thar are -
Healthcare
Education
Ed-tech


And we had to make something useful that could facilitate the online activities and make things easier to do by an online platform.

So we choose the field of ed-tech as we saw a major problem in it that was in online teaching.

Problem it solves:

Technology has never been a bigger part of our lives than it is now.
We have witnessed enough evidence that suggests technology is man’s greatest achievement and science’s biggest gift. People were connected across the global lockdowns, thanks to technology.
It was an overwhelming experience for some, while for some others it became a matter of concern. There were teachers who were not familiar to the available 
Tech stack required to go online. Some students and middle aged folk also faced issues with going contactless online. This added to the mental stress that these people faced, inducing a fear of technology. 
          To smoothen the journey of going online and to make sure technology acts as a bridge for knowledge flow rather than a barrier for anyone, we present a self learning platform, Atlas, where we provide tutorials of basic tools and technologies that have become a necessity today. Our mentors provide a beginner friendly and systematic explanation to make sure that anyone with no prerequisite knowledge can learn to use these tools .
          
          
          

Challenges we faced :

There were a lot of technical challenges as none of our team members had made any projects as big as this one. So certainly we had to drop some ideas that we initially thought we would add but due to limitations in our tech and mainly time we had to remove them from our project. 
Some of the features that we added in our project were difficult to implement like the logic of doubt forum as the add doubt button would add a certain doubt and will show that on the wall. For that there were many problems with coding it out. Somehow we managed it but still we couldn't improve the UI of doubt forum due to time limitations.
The delete doubt feature also took us quite a long time to actually have it working.

The front page of the website was the most time consuming and hard to implement thing. We gave it a lot of time to fully implement and have it running smoothly.
The CSS in the main page of the website took us like 3 days. We wanted our front page to look best and easy to use UI. As our main idea was to teach people who are not much aware of the technological world to learn from it , so we had this clear thought in mind to have a clean and simple UI. In our team no one was that much familiar with that advanced level of css we had to use so we continuously had to learn a lot of things in order to implement it.

Another challenge was to record quality video lecture and to upload them and embed them on website. This task was also time consuming as we had to prepare scripts, record and edit videos and upload them.

One major challenge we faced was how will we host videos on our website as we did some research we find out it was not that simple to host our videos on website. This required high technical difficulties and also we then would have to buy a online hosting service. So we then decided instead of hosting videos we would upload them on youtube and then embed it in our website. This task was way easy to do as compared to the prior one.

As the project was quite large so there was certainly a problem of managing these many files. There were more than 100 files involved in the whole project and they were extremely difficult to manage. We tried to organize them as much as possible. But as we were all working on the project so it was getting hard to keep a track on the files and folders.

Ofcourse many imrovements can be done in it and i will be doing it soon but for now it was really fun making this project. As it was my first time participating in a hackathon my team and I are really proud of what we have built.
