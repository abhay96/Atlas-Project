There were a lot of technical challenges as none of our team members had made any projects as big as this one. So certainly we had to drop some ideas that we initially thought we would add but due to limitations in our tech and mainly time we had to remove them from our project. 
Some of the features that we added in our project were difficult to implement like the logic of doubt forum as the add doubt button would add a certain doubt and will show that on the wall. For that there were many problems with coding it out. Somehow we managed it but still we couldn't improve the UI of doubt forum due to time limitations.
The delete doubt feature also took us quite a long time to actually have it working.

The front page of the website was the most time consuming and hard to implement thing. We gave it a lot of time to fully implement and have it running smoothly.
The CSS in the main page of the website took us like 3 days. We wanted our front page to look best and easy to use UI. As our main idea was to teach people who are not much aware of the technological world to learn from it , so we had this clear thought in mind to have a clean and simple UI. In our team no one was that much familiar with that advanced level of css we had to use so we continuously had to learn a lot of things in order to implement it.

Another challenge was to record quality video lecture and to upload them and embed them on website. This task was also time consuming as we had to prepare scripts, record and edit videos and upload them.

One major challenge we faced was how will we host videos on our website as we did some research we find out it was not that simple to host our videos on website. This required high technical difficulties and also we then would have to buy a online hosting service. So we then decided instead of hosting videos we would upload them on youtube and then embed it in our website. This task was way easy to do as compared to the prior one.

As the project was quiet large so there was certainly a problem of managing these many files. There were more than 100 files involved in the whole project and they were extremely difficult to manage. We tried to organize them as much as possible. But as we were all working on the project so it was getting hard to keep a track on the files and folders.
